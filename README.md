### Overview
Just a simple project that uses React and Tailwind for the frontend. I use redux to manage state, instead of usereducer.

## What I learned
- Redux provider encapsulates what we have in index
- We create a slice which is used for state, and changing its state
- To access our store, we use use selector
- To affect our state in our componenet we use dispatch, to call our defined functions already
